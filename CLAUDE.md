# Cypress Automation Boilerplate — Claude Code

> A production-ready, command-first Cypress framework any team can fork, adapt, and ship.
> AI-powered from day one with Claude Code and GitHub Copilot built in.

---

## Who is this for?

Any engineering team that:

- Is starting a new web app and needs a maintainable test automation foundation
- Is migrating from page-object patterns or scattered test files
- Wants AI assistance (Claude Code + GitHub Copilot) wired into the framework from the start

This boilerplate is application-agnostic. Swap out the example modules for your app.

---

## What is this?

A three-layer Cypress framework with a single, non-negotiable architecture:

| Layer        | Location                      | Rule                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Config**   | `cypress/configs/**`          | Selectors, endpoints, routes — all `Object.freeze()` |
| **Commands** | `cypress/support/commands/**` | Atomic `cy.*` commands — one owner per name          |
| **Tests**    | `cypress/tests/**/*.cy.js`    | Thin orchestration of `cy.*` calls only              |

**Included out of the box:**

- `example/` module — full reference (UI config + API config + commands + spec)
- `saucedemo/` module — working example against a real demo app
- `cy.apiIntercept()` engine — config-driven network intercepts with auto-aliasing
- `cy.validateSchema()` — JSON schema validation for API responses
- `cy.ensureAuthenticated()` — session-cached auth (adapt to your auth flow)
- `cy.getByTestId()` — data-cy attribute selector
- Multi-environment support (`cypress.env.dev.json`, `.qa.json`, `.prod.json`)
- HTML test reports via Cypress Mochawesome Reporter
- Tag-based test filtering via `@cypress/grep`
- Path aliases (`@configs`, `@support`, `@fixtures`) via Webpack preprocessor

## When to use what?

### Skills — primary, use these first

The [Cypress AI Toolkit](https://github.com/cypress-io/ai-toolkit) skills are the primary way to write, fix, explain, and look up Cypress behavior. Reach for an agent only when the task needs multi-file investigation or a workflow gate (below).

| Task                                          | Skill             |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Create, update, or fix a test (E2E/component) | `cypress-author`  |
| Look up Cypress API/config/behavior in docs   | `cypress-docs`    |
| Explain or review an existing test, no edits  | `cypress-explain` |

### Agents — multi-step, reasoning-heavy tasks

Agents spawn an independent context and reason across multiple steps. Use them for tasks that require investigation, judgment, or multi-file changes — not for authoring a test (use `cypress-author` for that).

**Daily development:**

| Situation                        | Agent                |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Debugging a failing test locally | `cypress-bug-hunter` |

**Workflow / release** — these run at specific workflow gates:

| Situation                                         | Agent               |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Reviewing code / full QA gate before opening a PR | `pre-merge-qa-gate` |
| Opening a pull request                            | `pr-creator`        |

### npm scripts — running tests

| What                 | Command                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Interactive runner   | `npm run cy:open`                               |
| All tests headless   | `npm run cy:run`                                |
| Smoke tests only     | `npm run cy:run:smoke`                          |
| By tag               | `npm run cy:run:tag -- --env grepTags=@tagname` |
| Against specific env | `npm run cy:run -- --env configFile=qa`         |

## Why this architecture?

- **Selectors in one place** — update a constant in `configs/ui/`, every test that uses it updates automatically. No hunting through 50 spec files.
- **Commands own all complexity** — specs stay readable; changing a flow means fixing one command, not every test that calls it.
- **No `cy.wait(number)`** — `cy.apiWait('@alias')` waits for the actual network response, not a guessed duration. Tests pass everywhere, including slow CI.
- **No page objects** — commands are your page methods, config files are your locator maps, with explicit single-file ownership enforced by hooks. If your team comes from POM, see the [full comparison and migration guide](docs/reference/test-organization.md#part-5--the-pom-question-for-teams-coming-from-page-objects).

## Non-Negotiable Rules

```text
NEVER  →  cy.wait(number)              Use cy.apiWait() or .should('be.visible')
NEVER  →  hardcoded selectors          Use constants from cypress/configs/ui/**
NEVER  →  hardcoded endpoints/routes   Use constants from cypress/configs/api/** and routes.js
NEVER  →  new *.actions.js files       Command-first only
NEVER  →  new page-object wrappers     Command-first only
NEVER  →  real credentials in code     Use cypress.env.json (local) or env vars (CI)
NEVER  →  create new config/command    Without searching for an existing one first

ALWAYS →  cy.ensureAuthenticated()     In beforeEach() for any auth-required test
ALWAYS →  config constants             Check configs before adding any selector
ALWAYS →  one command = one owner      Verify name is unique in commands.js
ALWAYS →  data-cy attributes           For all new selectors you add to the app
```

Hooks in `.claude/hooks/` enforce these automatically on every file write.

> **Search by value, not by filename.** "Searching for an existing one first" means grepping the
> literal selector/endpoint/route string across `cypress/configs/**` and
> `cypress/support/commands/**` — not just checking the one folder whose name matches this
> module. The same locator, endpoint, or command can already exist in a differently-named or
> differently-organized file; folder/module-naming conventions are a starting point, not a search
> boundary. A filename-only check that finds nothing is not the same as a value-based check that
> finds nothing.

## Adapting This Boilerplate for Your Application

1. **Remove example modules** — delete `saucedemo/` and `example/` after studying them
2. **Update `cypress.env.json`** — set `baseUrl`, `username`, `password`, `authUrl` for your app
3. **Adapt `cy.ensureAuthenticated()`** in `cypress/support/commands/common/auth.commands.js`
4. **Add your modules** using the checklist:

```text
1. API config    → cypress/configs/api/modules/[module]/[module].api.js
2. UI config     → cypress/configs/ui/modules/[module]/[module].ui.js
3. Routes        → cypress/configs/app/routes.js
4. Commands      → cypress/support/commands/modules/[module].commands.js
5. Register      → cypress/support/commands.js
6. Spec          → cypress/tests/[module]/smoke/[module]-smoke.cy.js
```

## Pre-Merge Checklist

```text
[ ] No hardcoded selectors — all from cypress/configs/ui/**
[ ] No hardcoded endpoints/routes — all from cypress/configs/api/** and routes.js
[ ] No new *.actions.js or page-object files
[ ] No cy.wait(number) — grep -r "cy\.wait([0-9]" cypress/ shows zero
[ ] cy.ensureAuthenticated() in beforeEach() of auth-required specs
[ ] New command registered in cypress/support/commands.js
[ ] Lint passes: npm run lint
[ ] If bug fix: regression test named [BUG-NNN] present
```

Run the `pre-merge-qa-gate` agent for a full PASS / PASS_WITH_ACTIONS / BLOCK verdict.
